# AG-LCD

A feature-complete rust port of the LiquidCrystal library for arduino systems. Some functions and flags
have been renamed or added for clarity, but all of the same features are available in this library that
are available in LiquidCrystal.

This library has only been tested on an Arduino Nano. If you test it on other systems and find bugs
please add issues to this project so that I can fix them.
